# Quoridor

## Written Rules

Be the first player to move their pawn to any space on the opposite side of the board.

- Players take turns moving their pawn or placing a fence.
- Pawns can move one space horizontally or vertically.
- Pawns can jump over another pawn if it is directly in their path, landing on the space behind it
    - If that space is blocked by a wall, the player can move to the open space to the right or left
- Fences must be placed between two squares.
- Fences cannot be placed so that a player has no path to their target destination.
