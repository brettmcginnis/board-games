# Connect Four

## Written Rules

- Players take turns dropping discs into a grid until one player has four in a row. 
- The first player to get four discs in a row wins!
- The four discs can be in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
- If the board fills up before either player gets four in a row, the game is a draw
